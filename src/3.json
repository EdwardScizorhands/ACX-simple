Briefly, a late uncle of mine spent most of his time in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the Guntur District of Andhra Pradesh helping bring modern diagnostic techniques to 3 charitable medical centers there.   This year, in memory of roughly the 40th anniversary of his passing, my dad and aunt (i.e., his brother and sister) would like to give donations to those centers.   Alas, our family has long lost any direct tie or, heck, even loose penpal relationships with anyone at those centers.  \\n\\nP.S.  Out of curiosity --- and what I admit perhaps is quite culturally ignorant curiosity --- is it common in India generally (or Andhra Pradesh specifically) for charitable organizations to be tied to locals who have gained renown as, I guess, \\\"gurus\\\" would be the appropriate word... and not just during the life of those gurus but many decades thereafter?  Now, don't get me wrong, I'm well aware that there's nontrivial examples of this in European religious traditions.   Heck, there's obviously the super-famous European religious example regarding a charity work in India in the form of Mother Teresa who's now Saint Teresa of Calcutta in the Catholic Church.   I'm not saying the general phenomenon of ascribing saintly/touched-by-the-divine attributes to humanitarians strikes me as surprising.   However, I ask given my --- again perhaps quite culturally ignorant --- prior that people ascribing an unusually strong connection between a charity's founder and the divine might, ahem, make that charity a little more cultish and less committed to best practices than the average charity.   \\n\\nP.P.S.  In case anyone's still reading and now wondering who this guru was/is specifically in this case of my late uncle's work in the Guntur District of Andhra Pradesh, wonder no further.  The guru in question is Anasuya Devī ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anasuya_Dev%C4%AB ).\\n\\nThanks again. :)\",\"date\":\"2021-02-07T15:46:15.470Z\",\"deleted\":false,\"name\":\"Bill Kaminsky\",\"photo_url\":null,\"reactions\":{\"❤\":1},\"is_author\":false,\"reactor_names\":[],\"reaction\":null,\"children\":[],\"bans\":[],\"user_banned\":false,\"user_banned_for_comment\":false,\"tags\":[\"founding\"],\"score\":0.011904761904761904},{\"id\":1207987,\"user_id\":25591651,\"publication_id\":89120,\"post_id\":32218385,\"ancestor_path\":\"\",\"body\":\"Does everyone still hate the ability to like comments?

It isn't just Evil Criminals who need secure cryptography.  The dissidents trying to organize some sort of resistance to people like Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping need secure cryptography.  If there's secure crypto they can use, then kiddie-porn peddlers can use it too.  You can't have it both ways.  So what is it that's so important that you need to solidify the hold of autocrats and dictators on power?  What's so important that you'll risk giving that power to the actually competent Donald Trump equivalent, or his counterpart on the left, who may take office in 2025 or 2029?\\n\\nI'll assume that what you actually care about are the real children being abused for the sake of making child porn.  If what you care about is the fact that a bunch of people are getting their jollies looking at even computer-generated pictures of naked children and this strikes you as outrageously wrong, is it really as outrageously wrong as e.g. a million Uighurs in concentration camps?\\n\\nSo, you want to protect the actual children being abused.  Good for you.  *This won't work*.  If pedophiles willing to act on their philia make up 5% of the population, then 5% of the (still mostly) free world's population includes enough Phil Zimmermans that the pedophiles will have secure networks in the end.  You're still hurting the people who need secure crypto and don't have 5% of the population actively working on their cause and/or don't live in a world free enough where they can read academic papers and download software from foreign servers without being arrested, but you're not helping the abused children.\\n\\nThere would, in the hypothetical case where you get your ban on strong crypto, be a brief period where you can round up a bunch of low-hanging fruit among the pedophiles who haven't gotten around to using good bootleg crypto, but that period will end.  And the low-hanging fruit you get out of that, will mostly be the middlemen who aren't directly hurting anyone.\\n\\nThe people who are actually abusing children to make kiddie porn for profit, are the smallest and most extremely paranoid subset of the pedophile population.  Even if you break their codes, all that's going to get you is the name of the Starbucks whose WiFi they used to upload the porn from a burner laptop.  Some of them will be careless, but we've probably got most of those already and it's not enough.\\n\\nAnd you aren't getting the rank and file of the supposed 5% either, because no way are you going to actually lock up 5% of the population.  You could I suppose have the FBI Master Computer compile a list of all the people it thinks are downloading kiddie porn and use it to get them fired from most of the good jobs, but that just leaves them with even less to lose by downloading kiddie porn.\\n\\nI get that you think you can eliminate, or mostly have eliminated, the demand for kiddie porn by driving the middlemen out of business.  And that might work if you could drive them *permanently* out of business.  What you're proposing, though, is just disrupting that line of business in a way that might as well be calculated to breed a resistant strain.\\n\\nOr, worse, multiple resistant strains.  Because anything that fragments this industry, makes the abused-child problem worse.  Assume every pedophile is so jaded that they need pictures of a new abused child every day for their sexually active life; call it fifty years, and 50*365 = 18,250 abused children meet the demand.  Doesn't matter whether pedophiles represent 5% of the population or 0.5% or 0.05%, the demand is for 18,250 abused children.  Every one from the 18,251st on is flooding a saturated market, driving down the prices and the incentives for every would-be provider.\\n\\nBut if you break up the market into a hundred little networks, each with their own home-rolled strong crypto but unwilling to trust the others, then you need 1.8 million abused children to saturate the demand.  Even if you drive 90% of the would-be consumers out of the market altogether, the 0.5% of the population that remains is going to demand 1.8 million abused children.\\n\\nIf you're interested in actually preventing children from being abused, and you're not so naive as to believe you can completely and totally eliminate the market for child pornography, then your best bet is for that market to be as free and open as it plausibly can be.  And then flood it with many*18K deepfakes and legacy pics, to the point where abusing a child for kiddie-porn profit brings a very low reward to balance against the risk that a busybody neighbor or schoolteacher will call social services.\\n\\nAlso, stop thinking that this problem can be solved with a push of the button on the FBI Master Computer, and make sure that your local police and social-services departments are keeping an eye open for indications that children are being abused.  If nothing else, most of the children who are being abused, *aren't* being abused for kiddie-porn profit, and that's not going to change no matter what happens with the crypto.\",\"date\":\"2021-02-05T20:29:10.979Z\",\"deleted\":false,\"name\":\"John Schilling\",\"photo_url\":null,\"reactions\":{\"❤\":6},\"is_author\":false,\"reactor_names\":[],\"reaction\":null,\"children\":[{\"id\":1205871,\"user_id\":25594418,\"publication_id\":89120,\"post_id\":32218385,\"ancestor_path\":\"1196862.1200529\",\"body\":\"Don't the children who are getting abused deserve privacy too?

The notion that the majority of the dark web's visits involve pedophilia raises serious questions about the tradeoffs between safety and privacy that Tor hidden services allow. But as WIRED wrote at the time, the pedophilia sites represented only 2 percent of Tor hidden services---a small number of popular kiddie porn sites draw a large percentage of the dark web's traffic, it seems. Categories of sites ranging from drug markets to discussion forums to whistleblowing sites all accounted for larger slices of the dark web. Even Facebook has now launched its own Tor hidden service.\\n\\nThe Tor Project also identified numerous caveats that might have led to the over-representation of pedophilia sites in the study's findings: Law enforcement and anti-abuse organizations often visit child porn sites to track and infiltrate them. Hackers sometimes launch floods of fraudulent traffic at the sites with the aim of taking them offline. Unstable sites that frequently go offline might generate more visit counts in the study's methodology. And sites visited through Tor2Web, a tool designed to make Tor hidden services more accessible to non-anonymous users, would be underrepresented, shifting more of the findings towards sites whose content requires strong anonymity.\\\"\\n\\nhttps://www.wired.com/2015/01/department-justice-80-percent-tor-traffic-child-porn/\\n\\nI'll admit I was surprised the numbers were even that high, but the fact remains that while all criminals will use secure communications, they will always be a tiny fraction of the total of people who use secure communications.\\n\\nIn any case, if you outlaw strong encryption, only outlaws will have strong encryption.

For example, any time I see that something is being done under the banner of anti-racism, I worry. Ibram X. Kendi is most responsible for the rise of the term, and his definitions have scary implications.\\n\\nAccording to Kendi, racist policies are those that promote inequity and anti-racist policies are those that reduce it. Note the use of inequity instead of inequality: inequity is about outcomes, not fair treatment. For Kendi there is no such thing as a \\\"not racist\\\" policy: racist and anti-racist are the only two options. If you support a racist policy, or oppose an anti-racist policy, then you are a racist.\\n\\nAdditionally, universities seem terrified of accusations of racism and tend to capitulate rather quickly. With this idea of anti-racism and a university that will likely never push back, we could end up with supposedly anti-racist policies that I think would reinforce what most people think of as \\\"racism.\\\"\\n\\nI'll quote Kendi in some of his own words:\\nhttps://newdiscourses.com/2020/07/defining-racism-ibram-kendi-weird-definition-antiracism/\\n&gt; The opposite of “racist” isn’t “not-racist.” It is “anti-racist.” What’s the difference? One endorses either the idea of a racial hierarchy as a racist, or racial equality as an anti-racist. One either believes problems are rooted in groups of people, as a racist, or locates the roots of problems in power and policies, as an anti-racist. One either allows racial inequities to persevere, as a racist, or confronts racial inequities, as an anti-racist. There is no in between safe space of “not racist.” The claim of “not racist” neutrality is a mask for racism.\\n&gt; A racist policy is any measure that produces or sustains racial inequity between racial groups. An antiracist policy is any measure that produces or sustains racial equity between racial groups. By policy, I mean written and unwritten laws, rules, procedures, processes, regulations, and guidelines that govern people. There is no such thing as a nonracist or race-neutral policy. Every policy in every institution in every community in every nation is producing or sustaining either racial inequity or equity between racial groups.\\n\\nWith these definitions conducting race-blind admissions becomes racist, but only if it reduces the amount of people of color admitted. If it increases admissions among that population, it is anti-racist!\\n\\nWith this kind of consequentialist definition, and an unresponsiveness to evidence, activists get a blank check to push any kind of policy they want in the name of anti-racism.\",\"date\":\"2021-02-05T21:24:21.352Z\",\"deleted\":false,\"name\":\"adamsb6\",\"photo_url\":null,\"reactions\":{\"❤\":5},\"is_author\":false,\"reactor_names\":[],\"reaction\":null,\"children\":[{\"id\":1201881,\"user_id\":25710446,\"publication_id\":89120,\"post_id\":32218385,\"ancestor_path\":\"1195318.1195643.1197789.1199587.1200123.1200927\",\"body\":\"In my example, we're talking an enormous amount of money, an enormous amount of people's time, and an enormous amount of other resources such as faculty positions (no less than 15 faculty positions!) spent for - what?

It can execute things at least better than previous ones.\\n\\nSecond, the population is really really diverse. Like, you go 50km North and the whole damn language changes. And this basically happens *every* 50km in many parts. Of course, language differences imply cultural differences and all other things.\\n\\nNow, given an efficient government that seemingly wants to push good agendas along with evil ones, I'm not sure how long it can sustain. Given the diversity, it is obvious that the differences in opinions, beliefs etc are vastly different across the nation. The system might sustain a decade and a half, but wouldn't be able to go for 4 decades like the previous one.\\n\\nSuppose it really, really wants to limit freedom. How would they go about it? It surely cannot be done in a decade if you think about it. This can be a whole discussion of its own, but I'll give one example. The people have multiple levels of attachments with the society. First, they have the 3-5 people family. They all like different Gods, have different views, might be living with their siblings' families etc. Still, it is a fairly structured and mostly mono-culture. Then would come the families of cousins. They're probably going to be totally different in their beliefs - political, religious etc. Yet, the mono-culture can still be seen. Next is their caste - totally different dynamics! They'll have a common accepted structure of what the caste in general puts across as their collective beliefs. The moment we start looking at the village the whole cultural monotony falls apart. People may speak different languages in their homes within the village, they will have different festivals, different clothing styles, different ways to greet each other and so on. Let's, for now, ignore the rest of the levels. This shows how deep the penetration has to be to be able to eradicate the freedom.\\n\\nSocio-political diversity combined with large population and - frankly - unique thinking patterns are important factors.\",\"date\":\"2021-02-08T06:13:51.853Z\",\"deleted\":false,\"name\":\"Dhavan\",\"photo_url\":null,\"reactions\":{\"❤\":1},\"is_author\":false,\"reactor_names\":[],\"reaction\":null,\"children\":[],\"bans\":[],\"user_banned\":false,\"user_banned_for_comment\":false,\"tags\":[],\"score\":0.011904761904761904}],\"bans\":[],\"user_banned\":false,\"user_banned_for_comment\":false,\"tags\":[],\"score\":0.023809523809523808},{\"id\":1194882,\"user_id\":8700789,\"publication_id\":89120,\"post_id\":32218385,\"ancestor_path\":\"\",\"body\":\"Now that you're being funded are you planning to increase the time working on the blog, or will your focus mainly be on your new clinic?\",\"date\":\"2021-02-05T08:13:31.009Z\",\"deleted\":false,\"name\":\"Men of Steel\",\"photo_url\":\"https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c301e79a-bd3e-45e6-91e2-9e8418b561cd_300x168.jpeg\",\"reactions\":{\"❤\":0},\"is_author\":false,\"reactor_names\":[],\"reaction\":null,\"children\":[],\"bans\":[],\"user_banned\":false,\"user_banned_for_comment\":false,\"tags\":[],\"score\":0.005952380952380952},{\"id\":1194865,\"user_id\":4281489,\"publication_id\":89120,\"post_id\":32218385,\"ancestor_path\":\"\",\"body\":\"I’m a software developer the middle of a job search.
