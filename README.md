# ACX-simple
Simple interface for ACX comments

# This is not ready for normal users yet.

Read this if you want to help debug.

# How to install

Git clone, then "load unpacked extension" the src/ directory.

# Notes

* For a given ACX post, add "/comments" to the end to load the simple UI.

** Did you know there was already a page there? That's the one I overwrite

* This only shows the top level of posts.

* This does not show the name of the person who wrote it (but it does show their picture, if set).

* I *think* this works just fine if ACX-tweaks is also installed.

* I clumsily reload the page in the background to get a URL -> postID mapping. Is there a better way to do this? At least I only have to do it once.
