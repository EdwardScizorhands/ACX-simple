# ACX-simple
Simple interface for ACX comments

# This is not ready for normal users yet.

Installing this won't ruin anything unless you are using the "/comments" page, but the functionality you want isn't there. This is just for brave people to look for bugs.

## How to install

Git clone, then "load unpacked extension" the src/ directory.

## Notes

* For a given ACX post, add "/comments" to the end to load the simple UI.
  * Did you know there was already a page there? That's the one I overwrite. I didn't even mean to.

* This only shows the top level of posts.

* You can't even reply! 

* This does not show the name of the person who wrote it (but it does show their picture, if set).

* I *think* this works just fine if ACX-tweaks is also installed.

* I clumsily reload the page in the background to get a URL -> postID mapping. Is there a better way to do this? At least I only have to do it once.
